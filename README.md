In This repository, we demonstrate a sum protocol.
1. A manager creates players with a random number for each player (doesn't have to be uniqe).
2. The players send messages with their numbers to one another throgh channels.
3. After they get all the messages, they sum the numbers and print the result.

We expect the results to be equal (because non of the messages went lost).
